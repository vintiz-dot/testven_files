        <h1>Application for Primary ESL Teacher (Japanese International Program)</h1>

        <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>

        <p>It is with great respect for the educational mission of the Japanese International School (JIS) that I submit
            my application for the Primary ESL Teacher position. Having observed the educational landscape in Hanoi for
            several years, I am deeply impressed by JIS’s commitment to the philosophy of <strong>"Minh Triết"
                (Wisdom)</strong> and the development of the whole child through Morality, Intelligence, and Practice.
            As an educator with a background in Engineering, I share the conviction that true education requires the
            harmonious development of the mind and the character.</p>

        <p>While my academic background is in Engineering, my passion lies in <strong>Primary Education</strong> and
            <strong>Language Acquisition</strong>. I believe my unique profile offers a distinct advantage to the JIS
            curriculum, particularly in addressing the requirement for integrated Art and English learning:
        </p>

        <p><strong>1. Bridging Art, English, and Engineering (STEAM):</strong><br>
            The JIS curriculum values "Practice" (*Hành*) and "Aesthetics" (*Mỹ*). With my engineering degree, I do not
            just teach English vocabulary from a textbook; I create <strong>"Makerspace" lessons</strong> where students
            design, draw, and build. Whether we are constructing paper structures or drawing geometric art, students are
            learning the English language of shape, function, and design. This directly addresses the school’s need for
            an educator who can bridge <strong>ESL and Art</strong> within the Cambridge Primary framework.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Alignment with Japanese Educational Values:</strong><br>
            I understand that in the Japanese educational model, the classroom is a community founded on respect and
            discipline. My teaching philosophy emphasizes <strong>collaborative learning</strong> and <strong>shared
                responsibility</strong>. I view the teacher not just as an instructor, but as a moral role model who
            guides students in etiquette and resilience alongside grammar and phonics. I am eager to support the
            school’s unique culture, including the emphasis on physical health and manners.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Cambridge Curriculum Expertise:</strong><br>
            At Victoria Thăng Long and Happy English Club, I have extensively utilized <strong>Inquiry-Based
                Learning</strong> to make the Cambridge curriculum accessible to Vietnamese learners. I have a proven
            track record of differentiating instruction for mixed-ability classes, using visual scaffolding and
            kinesthetic activities to ensure that every child, regardless of their starting point, can engage with the
            material and build confidence.</p>

        <p>I hold a Bachelor of Engineering, a 120-Hour TESOL certification, and am currently finalizing my U.S.
            Teaching License with a focus on Inclusive Pedagogy. I am eager to bring my energy, my technical creativity,
            and my dedication to holistic education to the JIS team.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to
            the wisdom and growth of JIS students.</p>

            Sincerely,
