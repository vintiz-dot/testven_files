        <h2>1. Professional Growth: The Shift to Cognitive Rigor</h2>
        <p>Over the past 12 weeks, my teaching practice has undergone a fundamental shift from managing activities to
            facilitating rigorous cognitive work. In the early weeks (Unit 2), my focus was largely on logistics—keeping
            the "Station Rotation" moving and ensuring students completed the worksheet. However, my data revealed that
            while engagement was high, deep understanding was inconsistent. The turning point came during the "Factoring
            Expressions" unit. By introducing the prompt, "Explain this concept to a 2-year-old," I moved beyond
            procedural fluency to conceptual mastery. I learned that true rigor isn't about giving harder problems, but
            about demanding clearer justifications.</p>

        <p>This Clinical Practice has prepared me to meet the needs of tomorrow's learners by cementing my belief in
            <strong>Neurodiversity-Affirming pedagogy</strong>. Seeing "David" (Case Study) thrive when given a digital
            "safe harbor" for reading proved that anxiety is an access barrier, not a lack of ability. I am now equipped
            to design learning environments that lower the affective filter while keeping expectations high.</p>

        <h2>2. Impact on Student Learning</h2>
        <p>The impact of this shift is visible in the data. My focus students showed measurable growth not just in
            content, but in their mathematical identity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Student 1 (Advanced):</strong> Moved from passive completion to active leadership, scoring 4/4
                in collaborative problem solving by the final unit.</li>
            <li><strong>Student 2 (SLN):</strong> Overcame persistent "sign errors" through the use of visual Algebra
                Tiles, improving from 50% to 90% content mastery on the final check.</li>
            <li><strong>Student 3 (ELL):</strong> Leveraged visual bar models to bridge the language gap, moving from
                "Developing" to "Proficient" in interpreting proportional relationships.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="collaboration-grid">

                <h4>Partnering with Families</h4>
                <p>My communication strategy focused on <strong>"demystifying the math."</strong> For Student 2 (who
                    struggled with performance anxiety), I sent weekly "Success Snapshots" to his caregivers—photos of
                    him correctly solving a problem on the whiteboard. This shifted the home narrative from "he's
                    struggling" to "he's building skills." I provided families with non-technical "conversation
                    starters" (e.g., "Ask him to show you how he grouped the items") rather than extra worksheets,
                    turning the home environment into a place of celebration rather than drilling.</p>

            <div class="collab-card">
                <h4>Collaborating with Colleagues</h4>
                <p>I actively collaborated with my Vietnamese co-teacher to align our vocabulary. We realized students
                    were confused because we used different terms for "slope" and "rate of change." By creating a shared
                    <strong>Bilingual Vocabulary Anchor Chart</strong>, we eliminated this friction. I also engaged in
                    weekly coaching cycles with my mentor, Dennis, who helped me refine the logistics of my "Station
                    Rotation" model (moving tasks, not students) to maximize instructional time.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Professional Development:</strong> To further my growth, I have registered
            for the <em>NCTM Annual Meeting (Fall 2025)</em> to deepen my understanding of equitable math pedagogy. I am
            also currently conducting a book study of Jo Boaler's <em>"Mathematical Mindsets"</em> to better support
            students with math anxiety.</p>
