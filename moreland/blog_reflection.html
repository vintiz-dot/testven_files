        <h2>1. Summary of Implementation</h2>
        <p>In this unit, I implemented an authentic performance assessment challenging Grade 7 students to apply <strong>factoring and the distributive property (7.EE.A.1)</strong> to real-world design scenarios. Students chose between designing "Supply Kits" for a community orphanage (interpreting GCF as the number of kits) or planning a "Mural Layout" (interpreting factors as dimensions).</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3><i data-lucide="check-circle"></i> Successes & Live Evidence</h3>
            <p>The transition from procedural fluency to conceptual application was stark. The "Maximization vs. Value" debate that spontaneously erupted during the Supply Kit activity was a highlight (InTASC 5). Students argued whether it was better to have <em>more</em> small kits (High GCF) or <em>fewer</em> substantial kits (Lower Common Factor). This proved they weren't just calculating numbers; they were analyzing the <strong>implications</strong> of those numbers.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Watch the Live Assessment:</strong> Observe students engaging in the "Mural Layout" reasoning and board work.</p>

            <h3><i data-lucide="alert-circle"></i> Challenges</h3>
            <p>While engagement was high, the debate occasionally drifted into "philosophy" rather than mathematics. One student noted, "This is becoming philosophy, not math," highlighting a need to anchor their arguments more firmly in quantitative data. Additionally, some students struggled with the initial leap from abstract variables ($12x + 18y$) to concrete items, requiring significant scaffolding with visual bar models.</p>

        <h2>2. Guiding Self- & Peer-Assessment</h2>
        <p>To foster ownership (InTASC 6), I introduced the analytic rubric <em>before</em> the final product creation. We used a "Simplified Checklist" version for peer review:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-Assessment:</strong> Students assessed their initial drafts against the "Mathematical Accuracy" criterion. I asked them to highlight where they showed their GCF calculation explicitly.</li>
            <li><strong>Peer-Feedback Loop:</strong> In pairs, students exchanged planning sheets. I provided sentence stems ("I see you factored... but have you considered...") to structure their feedback. This was crucial for my ELL students (Student 3) to participate meaningfully.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Analysis of Student Achievement</h2>
        <p>Data from the final rubric scoring revealed distinct patterns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Advanced Learners (Student 1):</strong> Excelled in "Critical Thinking." Student 1 didn't just find the GCF; he diagrammed the mural dimensions to prove why certain factor pairs were spatially impossible, demonstrating deep mastery of geometric application.</li>
            <li><strong>ELL Students (Student 3):</strong> Showed significant growth in "Mathematical Accuracy" (90%) but struggled with the "Explanation" criterion due to linguistic load. However, the visual nature of the mural task allowed Student 3 to demonstrate understanding without relying solely on complex text.</li>
            <li><strong>Students with Learning Needs (Student 2):</strong> Struggled with "Organization." While the math was often correct, the connection between their factored expression and their design decision was sometimes lost. This indicates a need for more graphic organizers in the planning phase.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Evaluating the Rubric</h2>
        <div class="rubric-evaluation">
            <div class="rubric-card">
                <h4>What Worked</h4>
                <p>The <strong>"Critical Thinking"</strong> row was essential. It allowed me to reward students who proposed creative, less obvious factorizations (e.g., opting for 6 larger kits instead of 12 small ones) even if it wasn't the "standard" textbook answer.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="rubric-card">
                <h4>Future Revisions</h4>
                <p>I need to refine the <strong>"Communication"</strong> criterion. It currently conflates "presentation skills" with "mathematical explanation." In the next iteration, I will split this to explicitly assess "Use of Mathematical Vocabulary" separately from "Presentation Clarity" to be fairer to ELLs.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Plan for Improvement</h2>
        <p>Based on this analysis, I will implement two specific changes for the next iteration:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The "Data-Based Rebuttal" Protocol:</strong> To prevent the "philosophy drift" observed in the debate, I will require students to calculate the <em>exact unit rate per person</em> for each proposed scenario before they are allowed to argue for it. This forces the critical thinking back to the evidence.</li>
            <li><strong>"Think-Pair-Share" for Board Work:</strong> I observed some performance anxiety when students presented their initial factorizations. I will implement a structured 30-second peer consultation period before any student is asked to present their solution publicly, lowering the affective filter.</li>
        </ol>
